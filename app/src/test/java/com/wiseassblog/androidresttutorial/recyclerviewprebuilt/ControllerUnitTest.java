/**
 * Test Driven Development Bonus: Before writing the methods themselves (a.k.a. writing the
 * "Implementation"), I've written some Unit Tests. In a nutshell, these Tests help me to figure out
 * what methods and logic I'll need for the class which I'm testing. This process is slow at first,
 * but once you become fast at writing Tests, you'll start to see how they actually help you write
 * Better Code, often at a Faster Pace.
 * <p>
 * I have some Videos on this topic on my youtube channel. Check them out for more info.
